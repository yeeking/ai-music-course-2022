# Putting the song together

This folder contains various python scripts that help you to analyse the MIDI files from MusicVAE.

That way, you can figure out what the notes are to send to diffsinger. 

Also you can find a mix down script that lets you mix the output from diffsinger and musicvae. 

This part is really hacky.
