# Code for the AI Song Writer system 

We created this AI song writer for part of the University of London/ Goldsmiths online computer science degree.

The degree runs on Coursera, and we wanted all the AI models to run inside the Coursera labs environment. 

This limited us to a docker container running with 4GB of RAM and two quite weak virtual CPUs. 

So do not expect to be competing with Taylor Swift using the code in this repository. 

You can read a paper about how we went about designing and evalauting our course here:
